Tricks when using CSS grid,
  1) Inspect with console, put dev tools on the bottom as our media queries are all set to monitor the width ☝️ .
    For scenerios when monitoring vw, have dev tools on the bottom.
  2) For scenerios when monitoring vh, have dev tools on the right.
  3) Images resize based on width, use dev tools at bottom of screen.
  4) get info on your image, write down pixel width view pixels.
